# Introduction

### What is Frontend Modernization?

Frontend Modernization is the process of upgrading or migrating frontend applications to modern frameworks and patterns. This typically involves:
- **Framework Migration**: Moving from one framework (like Struts) to another (like Angular)
- **Architecture Updates**: Implementing modern patterns and best practices
- **Dependency Updates**: Modernizing libraries and tooling to current versions
- **Code Transformation**: Adapting components, services, and state management to the new framework

## About This Lab

In this lab, you'll use IBM Bob's **Advanced mode** to migrate a pharmacy management application's frontend from Struts to Angular. The application currently uses:
- **Frontend Framework**: Struts

You'll migrate it to:
- **Frontend Framework**: Angular 19 (standalone components)


## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will learn how to use Bob's Advanced mode to:
- Analyze existing Struts applications and plan migrations
- Create Angular project structure with modern patterns
- Migrate Struts components to Angular standalone components
- Test and validate the migrated application

# Prerequisites

## Required Software

Before starting this lab, ensure you have the following installed:

### 1. IBM Bob IDE
- Ensure you have IBM Bob latest version installed
- Login through Bob to get connected
- Ensure you have access to **Advanced mode** (required for this lab)

### 2. Node.js and npm
Node.js is required for Angular development.

**Installation Instructions:**
- Download from: https://nodejs.org/ (LTS version recommended)
- Or use a version manager like nvm:
  ```bash
  # Install nvm (macOS/Linux)
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
  
  # Install Node.js LTS
  nvm install --lts
  nvm use --lts
  ```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see Node.js v18+ and npm v9+

### 3. Angular CLI
After installing Node.js, install the Angular CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
ng version
```

You should see Angular CLI version information.

# Frontend Migration with Bob's Advanced Mode

## Overview of Bob's Advanced Mode for Frontend Migration

IBM Bob's Advanced mode provides powerful capabilities for framework migrations:

### Key Features for Migration:
1. **Intelligent Analysis**: Bob can analyze the Struts codebase, examining component structure, state management, routing, API integration, and styling approaches. This comprehensive analysis provides insight into the application's architecture for the migration task.

2. **Migration Planning**: Bob creates a detailed migration plan that maps Struts components to Angular equivalents and designs service architecture, routing strategy, and dependency management. The plan also includes a comprehensive testing approach to ensure successful migration.

3. **Automated Code Generation**: Bob generates Angular code including standalone components with TypeScript, services with RxJS observables, and models/interfaces. It also creates routing configuration and module setup for the complete application structure.

4. **Iterative Refinement**: Bob works with you to reeview generated code, make adjustments based on your feedback, and debug any issues or errors

---

# Step-by-Step Exercises

1. **Open Bob Chat Interface**
   - If the Bob Chat window is not already open, click the Bob icon in your IDE's sidebar

2. **Switch to Bob's Advanced Mode**
   - Click on the current mode name at the bottom of the chat
   - Select "🚀 Advanced" from the dropdown menu
   - Confirm the mode switch if prompted

3. **Use Bob to initiate migration**
   
   In Bob's chat, type:
   ```
   I want to migrate this Struts application to utilize an Angular framework. Help me execute this migration. Create the frontend UI.
   ```

4. Bob will walk you through and complete the migration process, allowing you to approve tasks. Along the way, you can and should prompt Bob with specific questions or requests to guide the migration process. These can include:
   - Asking Bob to troubleshoot errors
   - Requesting specific code changes
   - Asking for clarification on migration steps
etc.


5. **Use Bob for testing**

   Once the application the is migrated to Angular, if not already suggested to do so, ask Bob to test the application by running it with the prompt:
   ```
   Help me run the migrated Angular application
   ```


### Expected Outcome
- Fully functional Angular application
- All features working correctly
- Optimized performance
- Clean, maintainable code
- Complete documentation

# Troubleshooting

## Issue 1: API Request Failed

**Symptom:**
```
{"apiProtocol":"openai"}
```

**Solution:**
Select "Retry" in the Bob chat window

---

## Issue 2: Backend Connection Issues

**Symptom:**
The Angular frontend cannot connect to the backend API. You may see errors like:
- `HTTP Error: Connection refused`
- `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`
- `CORS policy error`
- API calls returning 404 or timeout errors

**Root Cause:**
The Angular application is configured to connect to `http://localhost:9081/simple-pharmacy.war/api` in the `pharmacy-api.service.ts` file, but the backend server may not be running on this port or path.

**Solutions:**

### Solution A: Verify Backend Server is Running

1. **Check if the Liberty server is running:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the backend directory
   cd Bobathon/labs/lab3-ui-modernization/snapC-ui-mod
   
   # Check if Maven/Liberty server is running
   mvn liberty:status
   ```

2. **Start the backend server if not running:**
   ```bash
   # Start the Liberty server
   mvn liberty:run
   ```
   
   Wait until you see a message indicating the server has started successfully (typically shows "server is ready to run a smarter planet").

3. **Verify the backend is accessible:**
   Open a browser or use curl to test:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:9081/simple-pharmacy.war/api/dashboard
   ```
   
   You should receive a JSON response with dashboard data.

### Solution B: Update Frontend API Configuration

If your backend is running on a different port or path, update the API URL in the Angular service:

1. **Open the pharmacy API service file:**
   ```
   Bobathon/labs/lab3-ui-modernization/snapC-ui-mod/src/main/frontend/src/app/services/pharmacy-api.service.ts
   ```

2. **Update the `apiUrl` property (line 53):**
   ```typescript
   // Change from:
   private apiUrl = 'http://localhost:9081/simple-pharmacy.war/api';
   
   // To match your backend configuration, for example:
   private apiUrl = 'http://localhost:9080/simple-pharmacy/api';
   // or
   private apiUrl = 'http://localhost:8080/api';
   ```

3. **Restart the Angular development server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Then restart
   cd src/main/frontend
   npm start
   ```

### Solution C: Configure CORS (if needed)

If you see CORS-related errors, ensure the backend CORS filter is properly configured:

1. **Verify CORS filter exists:**
   Check `src/main/java/com/pharmacy/api/CorsFilter.java`

2. **Ensure CORS headers allow your frontend origin:**
   The filter should include:
   ```java
   response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
   response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS");
   response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type, Authorization");
   ```

3. **Restart the backend server** after any CORS configuration changes.

### Solution D: Use Angular Proxy Configuration (Alternative)

If you want to avoid CORS issues during development, configure an Angular proxy:

1. **Create a proxy configuration file:**
   Create `src/main/frontend/proxy.conf.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "/api": {
       "target": "http://localhost:9081/simple-pharmacy.war",
       "secure": false,
       "changeOrigin": true
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Update the API service to use relative URLs:**
   In `pharmacy-api.service.ts`:
   ```typescript
   private apiUrl = '/api';
   ```

3. **Start Angular with proxy:**
   ```bash
   ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json
   ```

### Verification Steps

After applying any solution:

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for any remaining errors
2. **Test API endpoints** by navigating through the application
3. **Verify data loads** on the dashboard, medicines, prescriptions, and orders pages
