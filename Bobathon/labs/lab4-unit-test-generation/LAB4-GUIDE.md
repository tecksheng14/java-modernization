# Introduction

### What is Unit Test Generation?

Unit Test Generation is the process of creating automated tests that verify individual components of an application work correctly in isolation. This typically involves:
- **Test Case Design**: Identifying what to test and how to test it
- **Mock Creation**: Isolating units from their dependencies
- **Assertion Writing**: Verifying expected behavior
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Testing boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Test Organization**: Structuring tests for maintainability

   Ask Bob:
   ```
   Generate comprehensive unit tests for all four REST API resource classes: PrescriptionResource.java, OrderResource.java, MedicineResource.java, and DashboardResource.java.
   
   For PrescriptionResource, include tests for:
   - getAllPrescriptions() - retrieval successful
   - getPrescriptionById() - found and not found scenarios
   - createPrescription() - success, invalid medicine ID, missing data, validation errors
   - validatePrescription() - success, not found, invalid status transitions
   
   For OrderResource, include tests for:
   - getAllOrders() and getOrderById()
   - createOrderFromPrescription() - success, prescription not found, not validated, insufficient stock
   - processPayment() - success, order not found, invalid status, payment method validation
   - collectOrder() - success, order not found, not paid
   
   For MedicineResource, include tests for:
   - getAllMedicines()
   - getMedicineById() - found and not found
   - searchMedicines() - with name, empty name, no results
   
   For DashboardResource, include tests for:

   - Proper aggregation of pending prescriptions and orders
   - Total counts are accurate
   
   Use Mockito to mock all repository dependencies (PrescriptionRepository, MedicineRepository, OrderRepository).
   Test HTTP response codes and response bodies.
   Use JUnit 5 and AssertJ for assertions.
   Create the test files in src/test/java/com/pharmacy/api/
   ```

2. **Run API Tests** (if not run automatically by Bob)
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

## Exercise 4: Generate Model Tests

1. **Test Model Classes**

   Generate unit tests for the model classes (Prescription, Order, Medicine). Include:
   - Constructor tests with valid data
   - Getter and setter tests
   - Edge cases (null values, boundary conditions)
   - Any business logic methods
   - toString(), equals(), and hashCode() if implemented
   
   These should be simple tests focusing on data integrity.
   ```

2. **Run Model Tests** (if not run automatically by Bob)
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

## Exercise 5: Test Coverage Analysis and Improvement

1. **Add Code Coverage Plugin**
   
   Ask Bob:
   ```

   Configure it to generate coverage reports.
   ```

2. **Run Coverage Report** (if not run automatically by Bob)
   ```bash
   mvn clean test jacoco:report
   ```

3. **Analyze Coverage**
   
   Ask Bob:
   ```
   Review the JaCoCo coverage report at target/site/jacoco/index.html.
   Identify any gaps in test coverage and suggest additional tests to improve coverage.
   ```

4. **Generate Missing Tests**
   - Based on Bob's analysis, ask for additional tests to cover gaps
   - Focus on achieving >80% code coverage

## Exercise 6: Integration and Edge Case Testing

1. **Add Integration-Style Tests**
   
   Ask Bob:
   ```
   Create integration-style tests that test multiple components together:
   - Test the full flow: create prescription → validate → create order → process payment → collect
   - Test error propagation between layers
   - Test concurrent access scenarios for repositories
   
   These tests should use real repository instances (not mocks) but still be unit tests.
   ```

2. **Add Edge Case Tests**
   
   Ask Bob:
   ```
   Create additional edge case tests for:
   - Concurrent modifications to the same prescription/order
   - Very large quantities or amounts
   - Special characters in patient names or medicine names
   - Date boundary conditions (expired prescriptions, future dates)
   - Empty or null collections
   ```

## Exercise 7: Test Organization and Documentation

1. **Organize Test Suite**
   
   Ask Bob:
   ```
   Review the test suite and suggest improvements for:
   - Test class organization and naming
   - Test method naming conventions
   - Common setup code that could be extracted
   - Test data builders or fixtures
   - Documentation and comments
   ```

2. **Create Test Documentation**
   
   Ask Bob:
   ```
   Create a TESTING.md document that includes:
   - Overview of the test suite structure
   - How to run tests (all tests, specific tests, with coverage)
   - Testing conventions and patterns used
   - How to add new tests
   - Coverage goals and current status
   ```

3. **Run Full Test Suite**
   ```bash
   mvn clean test
   ```

### Expected Outcome
- Complete test suite with 50+ test methods
- >80% code coverage across all layers
- All tests passing
- Well-organized and maintainable test code
- Comprehensive documentation
- Fast test execution (<30 seconds)
